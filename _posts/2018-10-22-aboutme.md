### kevin

I am a multidisciplinary design and engineering student, currently majoring in both Architecture and Construction Engineering/Management at Lawrence Technological University. I also specialize in... well, many, many other things. I pride myself in my awful <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1j9VyQhRDsZ5gbgfVuhGyY?si=66fe595fc96b41ac" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#6EFF7D">taste in music</span></a> and unamusing collection of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/N5Lu6z9" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#C56EFF">random pictures</span></a>. In essence, I'm all over the place. But that's okay, and that's why this website exists. This site serves as a repository and archive for all of my projects and hobbies over the years.

So how do I start? I'd like to think of this as a personal project, not something just for school or work; that wouldn't be fun. I want something where I can simply put stuff (for a lack of a better word) down, so I can see it all. And I feel that this would be a perfect way to explore and demonstrate the artistic power of CSS and HTML. I have so much to share but I have no idea how to go about it as I'm currently typing this out. I have over 6+ years worth of fun projects of various kinds. If only I knew where to begin to organize it...

	<figcaption> <p>I know how to organize. In fact, I do a lot of it.</p>

</figure>

For years, I've use every organizational tool at my disposable to keep track of everything, even the most meaningless and minute details, whether it be reminders to take out the trash, or to get a school assignment done, and believe it or not, even reminders to make reminders! Some call it redundant, I call it a necessity. 

If I'm such an expert, this should be easy. You know what, it is. I just have to <a href="https://kevinesmaell.github.io/projects/">**dive right into it**</a>.
