### Student
I am a multidisciplinary design and engineering student, currently majoring in both Architecture and Construction Engineering/Management at Lawrence Technological University. 

### Graphic Designer + Web Developer
I have 6+ years experience in graphic design and web design/development. Most notably I was the head of media advertising for student government at my high school (2018-2019). I am currently in the process of updating this portfolio website. Some other personal favorites include an informational site to advertise equity trading-signal algorithms I coded for a personal side-income project (2020), and two e-commerce websites for some friends' clothing brands (inactive). Another fun one was an online PUG (pick-up-game) lobby site for a multiplayer game I played when I was 15 by modifying a pre-existing open source PUG site.

### Musician
I have over 10 years of experience playing the acoustic and electric guitarand two years of experience playing the piano when I was younger, but frankly I never enjoyed it, and was never good. I'm currently trying to learn to play the drums!

### Cryptocurrency Enthusiast
I have been mining


### Senior Astral Projectionist
Fun fact: I have a deviated nasal septum which causes me to snore while I sleep, accompanied with low quality sleep. I also have occasional sleep paralysis episodes that occur every few weeks. Sleep paralysis is a condition identified by a brief loss of muscle control (atonia) right after falling asleep or waking up. People often have hallucinations during sleep paralysis episode which can very from person to person. Yeah, scary, I know.

I also specialize in... well, many, many other things. I pride myself in my awful <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1j9VyQhRDsZ5gbgfVuhGyY?si=66fe595fc96b41ac" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#6EFF7D">taste in music</span></a> and unamusing collection of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/N5Lu6z9" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#C56EFF">random pictures</span></a>. In essence, I'm all over the place. But that's okay, and that's why this website exists. This site serves as a repository and archive for all of my projects and hobbies over the years.
