### Student
I am a multidisciplinary design and engineering student, currently majoring in both Architecture and Construction Engineering/Management at Lawrence Technological University. 

### Graphic Designer + Web Developer
I have 6+ years experience in graphic design and web design/development. Most notably I was the head of media advertising for student government at my high school (2018-2019). I am currently in the process of updating this portfolio website. Some other personal favorites include an informational site to advertise equity trading-signal algorithms I coded for a personal side-income project (2020), and two e-commerce websites for some friends' clothing brands (inactive). Another fun one was an online PUG (pick-up-game) lobby site for a multiplayer game I played when I was 15 by modifying a pre-existing open source PUG site.

### Musician
I have been playing the acoustic and electric guitar for over 10 years. I have had around two years experience playing the piano in the past, but frankly I never enjoyed it, and was never good. I'm currently trying to learn to play the drums!

### Senior Astral Projectionist
Fun fact: I have a deviated nasal septum which causes me to snore while I sleep, accompanied with low quality sleep. I also have occasional sleep paralysis episodes that occur every few weeks. Sleep paralysis is a condition identified by a brief loss of muscle control (atonia) right after falling asleep or waking up. People often have hallucinations during sleep paralysis episode which can very from person to person. Yeah, scary, I know.



I also specialize in... well, many, many other things. I pride myself in my awful <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1j9VyQhRDsZ5gbgfVuhGyY?si=66fe595fc96b41ac" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#6EFF7D">taste in music</span></a> and unamusing collection of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/N5Lu6z9" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#C56EFF">random pictures</span></a>. In essence, I'm all over the place. But that's okay, and that's why this website exists. This site serves as a repository and archive for all of my projects and hobbies over the years.

So how do I start? I'd like to think of this as a personal project, not something just for school or work; that wouldn't be fun. I want something where I can simply put stuff (for a lack of a better word) down, so I can see it all. And I feel that this would be a perfect way to explore and demonstrate the artistic power of CSS and HTML. I have so much to share but I have no idea how to go about it as I'm currently typing this out. I have over 6+ years worth of fun projects of various kinds. If only I knew where to begin to organize it...

For years, I've use every organizational tool at my disposable to keep track of everything, even the most meaningless and minute details, whether it be reminders to take out the trash, or to get a school assignment done, and believe it or not, even reminders to make reminders! Some call it redundant, I call it a necessity. 

If I'm such an expert, this should be easy. You know what, it is. I just have to <a href="https://kevinesmaell.github.io/projects/">**dive right into it**</a>.
