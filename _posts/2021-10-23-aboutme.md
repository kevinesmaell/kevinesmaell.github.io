### Student of Engineering Technology and Management
I am a multidisciplinary design and engineering student, pursuing a dual degree at Lawrence Technological University. 

### Student of Architecture
Architecture is my second major. I plan to complete the program to receive both of my degrees and licensure for architecture. I hope to use these degrees to pursue a career in real estate development.

### Real Estate Digital Marketing Analyst
I am currently employed as a marketing analyst contractor for Piper Partners at Keller Williams Realtry.

### Self-Employed/Personal Project Blockchain Technology Technician and Analyst
In addition to trading cryptocurrencies for around two years, I maintain, troubleshoot, and optimize computing units to exchange cryptocurrency derivatives within a P2P database as a sole proprietor.

### Artificial Intelligence Enthusiast
I am very enthusiastic about modern AI solutions. I am also an ex-employee of Refraction AI (2021), specializing in building and deploying robotic platforms for providing scalable last mile goods delivery in urban areas. I believe AI specifically in the transportation and logistics industry has many advantages: primarily improved sustainability, cost-efficiency, and a better consumer experience to name a few.

### Graphic Designer + Web Developer
I have 6+ years experience in graphic design and web design/development. I was the head of media advertising for student government at my high school (2018-2019). I am currently in the process of updating this portfolio website. Some other personal favorites include an informational site to advertise equity trading-signal algorithms I coded for a personal side-income project (2020), and two e-commerce websites for some friends' clothing brands (inactive). Another fun one was an online PUG (pick-up-game) lobby site for a multiplayer game I played when I was 15 by modifying a pre-existing open source PUG site.

### Guitar Player
I have over 10 years of experience playing the acoustic and electric guitar. I'm currently trying to learn to play the drums!

I also specialize in... well, many, many other things. I pride myself in my awful <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1j9VyQhRDsZ5gbgfVuhGyY?si=66fe595fc96b41ac" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#6EFF7D">taste in music</span></a> and unamusing collection of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/N5Lu6z9" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="color:#C56EFF">random pictures</span></a>. In essence, I'm all over the place. But that's okay, and that's why this website exists. This site serves as a repository and archive for all of my projects and hobbies over the years.
